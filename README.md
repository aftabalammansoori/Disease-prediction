![Home Page](https://github.com/aftabalammansoori/Mutiple-Disease-Prediction/blob/main/Home.png)

# 🏥 Multiple Disease Prediction Web App  

## 🚀 Overview  
This project is a **Streamlit-based web application** that predicts the likelihood of three diseases:  
✅ **Diabetes**  
✅ **Heart Disease**  
✅ **Parkinson’s Disease**  

The application uses **Machine Learning models** trained on medical datasets to provide quick and accurate predictions based on user inputs.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- **Machine Learning** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- **Streamlit** (for the interactive web interface)  
- **Data Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn)  

---

## 📂 Dataset Information  
The following datasets were used to train the models:  
- **Diabetes Dataset:** Contains medical parameters like glucose level, blood pressure, insulin, BMI, etc.  
- **Heart Disease Dataset:** Includes features like cholesterol, resting blood pressure, maximum heart rate, and more.  
- **Parkinson’s Dataset:** Consists of vocal attributes such as MDVP (fundamental frequency), jitter, and shimmer.
